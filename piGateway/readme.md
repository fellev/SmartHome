This repo contain a port of LowPowerLab RFM69 library, initially targeted at Arduino, to Raspberry Pi.
The Gateway code is a 1:1 replacement from Eric Tsai one to be run dirrectly on Raspberry, removing the need of a dedicated Arduino with Ethernet shield

Connect the RFM69 to the Raspberry PI

Using SPI part of Raspberry expantion port, with the IRQ connected to the pin 22 (GPIO_25)

```
3.3V  17
GND   20
SLCK  23
MISO  21
MOSI  19
NSS   24
DID0  22
```

The layout of the connection header is described at http://www.megaleecher.net/Raspberry_Pi_GPIO_Pinout_Helper

Install Git core, if not aleready done
```
sudo apt-get install git-core
```
Download the WiringPi latest version
```
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
```
A script is provided to easily build it
```
cd wiringPi
./build
```

Install Mosquitto and the development libraries
```
wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-stable.list
apt-get update
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients libmosquitto-dev
```

Compile the gateway
```
cd ~/piGateway
g++ Gateway.c rfm69.cpp -o Gateway -lwiringPi -lmosquitto -DRASPBERRY -DDEBUG
```

You can omit the -DDEBUG part, if you don't want the debug output to be produced

Launch the gateway
```
sudo ./Gateway
```
sudo is required as some of the WiringPi library need it
